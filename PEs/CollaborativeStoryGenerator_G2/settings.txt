on top of the Sydney Opera House; at twilight

inside Stonehenge; during the year 1000 b.c.

yesterday, upon Ingle Auditorium

on an alien spacecraft; 2000 years from now

during the birth of the universe; or it's death (no one is sure)

somewhere in suburbia; during the 70s

in the Pacific Ocean; on the way from Hawai'i to New Zealand
